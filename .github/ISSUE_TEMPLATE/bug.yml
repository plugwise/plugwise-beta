      label: How did you install plugwise-beta?
      description: >
        You could be using the core-integration and just asked to leave feedback/improvements here, but more likely you installed either through HACS or manually as a `custom_component`.
        Feel free to select Core even if you are actually **not** using plugwise-beta, no problem, we gladly look into it to see if we can upstream it to Core eventually!

      options:
        - HACS
        - Manually installed `custom_component`
        - Cloned from GitHub
        - Home Assistant Core

      label: Logging
      description: >-
        Very important to understand the problem, enable logging for `plugwise-beta:` in `configuration.yaml` by adding:

        ```
        logger:
          default: warn
          logs:
            custom_components.plugwise: debug
            plugwise.smile: debug
        ```

        After adding this, restart HA Core.

        After the restart has finished please look in the supervisor **Core** logs (follow the below link and select 'Core' from the dropdown).

        [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the supervisor logs.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_logs.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_logs/)

        There should be several lines related to `plugwise-beta`. Please show us the **complete** log-message that starts this:

        ```[custom_components.plugwise] Data: PlugwiseData(gateway={'smile_name': ...```

      label: Diagnostics information
      description: >-
        The Plugwise integration provides the ability to download diagnostic data
        on the device page (and on the integration dashboard).

        **It would really help if you could download the diagnostics data for the device you are having issues with,
        and drag-and-drop that file into the textbox below.**

        It generally allows pinpointing defects and thus resolving issues faster.
